Shouldn&rsquo;t we hope to be remembered by them? And shouldn&rsquo;t that provide us with some form of life after death?</p><p>I tend to disregard the idea of legacy&mdash;beyond what will extend this gift of observation further into the future. The way I see it, nothing will last forever. The very universe itself has an expiry date. Any attempt to prolong our personal existence&mdash;beyond the end of our observable life&mdash;is futile.</p><p>Yes, we may succeed in this goal and be remembered for some time, perhaps even a long time if we are truly a rare individual.</p><p>But what becomes of this legacy?</p><p>We need only look at what historians have achieved for those who came before us.</p><p>Time moves beyond our actions&mdash;beyond our ideals. The stories of our life become unburdened from our perception and left in the hands of others. Eventually, strangers.</p><p>What may be remembered, what was created, and who we were will all be warped and re-contextualized beyond our comprehension.</p><p>How many of the dead would be able to recognize themselves in the description of their character written by a historian a century after their passing?</p><p>We can strive for legacy, but whatever legacy it is certainly won&rsquo;t be ours.</p><p>But if not legacy, then what?</p><p>As you may have guessed, I believe that what&rsquo;s more important than a nebulous future is the present moment. Rather than focusing on how you will be remembered in the future, think about how you will be experienced now.</p><p>I think the filmmaker, David Lowery puts it brilliantly in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyn2wWwrwwU&amp;t=797s">&ldquo;Notes on a Scene&rdquo; with Vanity Fair for the film <em>The Green Knight</em></a>. While he talks specifically about his particular art, I believe the thought holds true more generally.</p><blockquote><p>As a filmmaker, it&rsquo;s really important to remind myself constantly that the movies I make, aren&rsquo;t all that important.</p><p>[&mldr;]</p><p>And so more important than the legacy I&rsquo;m creating for myself with my body of work is the way I comport myself as I make them, the integrity with which I live my life, and my attempts to be a good person, to do good in this world.</p><p>- David Lowery</p></blockquote><p>When I first heard this I was amazed by his humility. (Even more so because of how incredible I found <em>The Green Knight</em> to be.)</p><p>It also reminded me of a quote from Maya Angelou which I love:</p><blockquote><p>At the end of the day people won&rsquo;t remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.</p><p>- Maya Angelou</p></blockquote><p>As it will at the end of the day, so it will at the end of your life.</p><hr><p>So, personally, I will try to live my life with consideration of the present moment, focusing on how I comport myself in the creation of my work.</p><p>Ironically, this line of thinking may, in general, lead to a better legacy than focusing on legacy itself.</p><p class=date>2021-10-11</p></article></main></body></html>
