There is suddenly the possibility of failure.</p><p>But, this stress is doing us no good. At best, it will be a nagging fear in the back of our mind, and at worst, it can lead to poor judgment and a greater chance of failure.</p><p>How do we rid ourselves of this fear?</p><h2 id=i-forgive-yourself>I. Forgive yourself</h2><p>First, understand that you&rsquo;re not alone. Fear of failure is a form of stress that just about everyone has had to face at one point or another.</p><p>You&rsquo;re not broken.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t try to outright dismiss the fear or ignore it. This will only make things worse.</p><p>We often try to discount our emotions in various ways, to set them aside.</p><p>&ldquo;This is stupid. This project isn&rsquo;t even worth worrying about. Why do I feel this way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So-and-so never seems stressed. I should be more like them and push through.&rdquo;</p><p>Accept your emotions for what they are.</p><p><strong>You can only improve your situation if you come at it from a place of radical honesty.</strong></p><p>Give yourself the freedom to examine without self-judgment&mdash;the freedom to experience your emotions thoroughly and accurately. Only then begin to critically examine them.</p><h2 id=ii-the-fear-could-be-a-positive-indication>II. The fear could be a positive indication</h2><p>If someone challenged you to a bowling pin balancing competition, chances are you&rsquo;d have no fear of failure. You may be competitive about it, but you wouldn&rsquo;t be <em>afraid to fail.</em></p><p>Why is that?</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s a meaningless task. It&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;ve tied to your ego, it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;re worried about others judging you for, and it&rsquo;s not something you perceive as having any impact on your life.</p><hr><p>But you&rsquo;re feeling fear now, whether about a presentation, or a project, or a new business venture. So why is that?</p><p>Examine the fear you&rsquo;re feeling for a moment. Where is it coming from?</p><p>Sometimes this fear is an indication that we are starting down a path that feels <em>meaningful</em> to us. It&rsquo;s something important.</p><p>And what better way is there to live than to spend your time on <em>meaningful experiences.</em></p><p>So if you are feeling fear of failure, it could very well be a positive indication:</p><p><strong>You are heading down the right path.</strong></p><h2 id=iii-quelling-the-fear>III. Quelling the fear</h2><p>The above realization may provide you some peace. But it&rsquo;s unlikely to rid you of this fear altogether. (And rightfully so.)</p><p>To further reduce this fear, try to dig further. Let&rsquo;s get to the roots of it.</p><p>Have you started a new job? Maybe this fear stems from feeling <em>you don&rsquo;t yet have the skills to succeed?</em></p><p>Are you starting a podcast? Maybe the root is a worry that <em>no one will listen?</em></p><p>With each answer, ask yourself whether it&rsquo;s something you can control.</p><p>In the case of starting a new job, the fear that you might not yet have the skills to succeed may be rational. Likewise, it&rsquo;s something you can control.</p><p>Find peers at work that are willing to act as a mentor. Find educational resources and make a plan to work through them. Communicate openly and honestly with your team.</p><p><em>In many cases, the act of planning alone can significantly quell anxiety.</em></p><p>For the case of the podcast, the worry that no one will listen is rational, but it&rsquo;s not something you can directly control.</p><p>So what can you control that might improve the odds of people listening?</p><p>Dedicate some time to brainstorm ways to get the word out. Focus your attention on the actions you <em>can</em> take that will improve the probability of success.</p><h2 id=iv-regardless-of-outcome>IV. Regardless of outcome</h2><p>When you focus on what you have control over, you stop being a dreamer and a worrier. Instead, you become someone taking action&mdash;someone that is actively altering outcomes.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll be able to focus on education and actions&mdash;elements that will make you a better person, improving the likelihood of success for not just this dream, but every dream that follows it.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, working on this goal will have a real and meaningful effect on you.</p><p><em><strong>Focus on the right things. Even in failure, you&rsquo;ll succeed.</strong></em></p><h2 id=v-in-short>V. In short</h2><ol><li>Without self-judgment, experience your emotions <em>openly and honestly.</em></li><li>Realize the fear is a <em>positive indication.</em></li><li>Search for the <em>roots of the fear.</em></li><li>Create a plan of action targeting what you <em>have control over.</em></li><li>Regardless of your end goal, <em>remember what you&rsquo;re doing is self-improvement.</em></li></ol><p class=date>2021-06-12</p></article></main></body></html>
