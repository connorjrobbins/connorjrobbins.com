Our brains love negativity</h2><p>How often do you find yourself seeking out and engaging with content that will inspire you, uplift you, or otherwise leave you feeling better than you did before?</p><p><strong>How often do you find yourself doom-scrolling?</strong></p><p>Next time you&rsquo;re scrolling through the news, or social media, take a second to examine what content catches your attention the most.</p><p><em>Chances are it won&rsquo;t be the uplifting posts.</em></p><p>By default, most people are pre-disposed to engage with negative content. It&rsquo;s a quirk of the human brain.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a reason people love to bond over shared hatred towards a tv show, politician, or idea.</p><p><em>There&rsquo;s a reason we spend so much time obsessing over everything wrong with this world.</em></p><h2 id=ii-creators-know-this>II. Creators know this&mldr;</h2><p>and everyone else is left picking up the bill.</p><p>If you investigate the art and science of copywriting, or more generally, content creation and growth/engagement strategies, chances are you&rsquo;ll come across this advice: <strong>Use negative emotions to your advantage.</strong></p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s advertisements reminding you of what you don&rsquo;t have, news outlets re-framing events to their most negative form, or content creators focusing on things they hate rather than what they love&mdash;negativity works.</p><p>As a quick experiment which of these two statements causes a more visceral reaction in you:</p><ol><li>The one habit all billionaires share.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t have this one habit? Enjoy being poor&mldr;</li></ol><p>It&rsquo;s easy to get attention if you employ this method. But at what cost?</p><p>The best marketers understand this power, and <em>the least ethical employ it liberally.</em></p><h2 id=iii-but-you-still-have-a-choice>III. But you still have a choice</h2><p>While algorithms, ads, and marketers may often decide what gets placed in front of our eyes, we still have the choice of what to engage in.</p><p><strong>If attention is currency, we have the choice of where to spend it.</strong></p><p><em>You</em> decide what posts you like, telling the algorithm what you want to see more of. <em>You</em> get to decide whether to spend time reading the replies to a news story that distresses you. <em>You</em> can turn it all off and pick up a good book.</p><p>No matter the narrative others try to push, <em>you</em> have a choice.</p><h2 id=iv-is-it-worth-it>IV. Is it worth it?</h2><p>If we have a choice of what to engage with, how do we make the determination?</p><p>Take account of the content you consume.</p><p>Next time you&rsquo;re going to scroll through Twitter, note down how you feel before and after.</p><p>Do you feel better, or worse? More informed, or more confused? Optimistic, or pessimistic?</p><p>The content you consume should be working for you. It should improve your life, not be a drain on it.</p><p><strong>A little reflection and curation will do wonders.</strong></p><h2 id=v-isnt-it-sometimes-worth-it>V. Isn&rsquo;t it sometimes worth it?</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t mean to discourage staying up-to-date on world events or gaining a better understanding of our fellow man.</p><p>Sometimes deeply negative things deserve our attention and our understanding.</p><p><em>But, be intentional about your education.</em></p><p>Often, negative emotions can be a catalyst for change. Either internally, or in a grander sense.</p><p>This is most certainly a good thing.</p><p>But understand the cost associated with it. Your well-being has value. Ask yourself: &ldquo;What is this costing me, and what am I and the world getting out of it?&rdquo;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re going to invest your time, your happiness, and your well-being in something, it better be worth it.</p><h2 id=vi-do-what-you-can>VI. Do what you can</h2><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s worth investing time and energy in something negative if it will inform our perspective or improve the world.</p><p>For example, understanding social injustices, and climate change, is probably worth your time and energy.</p><p><em>But, you can be more intentional about it.</em></p><p>If you want to be informed on a topic, is scrolling the endless negative replies to a news story the best way to achieve that goal?</p><p>Chances are you&rsquo;d be better off reading a book or two on the topic. It&rsquo;ll be far less emotionally charged, and far more informative.</p><p>If you want to make an impact&mdash;change the world&mdash;is dedicating several hours a day to doom-scrolling and feeling bad the best way to achieve that goal?</p><p>Research what steps you can take, and which organizations you can support to make a meaningful change, and close the tweet that does nothing other than drain your optimism.</p><h2 id=vii-leave-the-rest>VII. Leave the rest</h2><p>Finally, understand your limitations.</p><p>There are only so many hours in a day, and there is only so much of yourself emotionally for you to give.</p><p><em>We can&rsquo;t know everything, and we can&rsquo;t fix everything.</em></p><p><strong>What are you willing and able to commit to?</strong></p><p>There is no sense in spending hours a day feeling terrible about American politics when you&rsquo;re a citizen of Ireland. Find an action you can take, find a meaningful way to get informed, and leave the rest.</p><p>For any given topic, effectively understand the issue at hand, and decide if you&rsquo;re able to make a positive change.</p><p><em>Act, or let it go.</em></p><p>There is no sense in allowing these things to pollute your mind when you cannot impact them or aren&rsquo;t committed to acting.</p><p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be investing your well-being for nothing.</p><hr><h2 id=viii-final>VIII. Final</h2><p>There exists an emotional asymmetry in the attention economy.</p><p>Content creators can alter the minds of millions, and many are doing so with no real focus on the ethics of their actions.</p><p>Recognize when others are playing on your attention with negative emotions.</p><p>There can be a strange king of glee in negativity. Don&rsquo;t fall for it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s insidious.</p><p>It may feel fulfilling for a moment, but it will slowly erode the light inside you.</p><p><em><strong>Be intentional with your attention.</strong></em></p><p class=date>2021-06-05</p></article></main></body></html>
