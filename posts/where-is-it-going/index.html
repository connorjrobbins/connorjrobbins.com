Walking in strange curves, circles, occasionally retracing its steps from only moments ago.</p><p><em>To me, it seemed lost.</em></p><p>I wondered what its life must be like. How it makes its decisions.</p><p>So low to the ground that pillbug must only perceive what is directly in front of it. And yet, it continues to travel. What is it searching for? Food? Companionship?</p><p>From where I sat, far above it, I could see the path it took&mdash;the wasted steps, the seemingly confused life it led.</p><p><em>Where is it heading?</em></p><p>How can it possibly decide where to step next when it lacks all the perspective I have? How does it work with such minimal knowledge?</p><hr><p>I imagined myself in a field of maize&mdash;stalks that rose far above me, my perspective limited to my immediate surroundings. <em>How would I get out?</em></p><p>Might I be frightened?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Would that stop me from acting? Stop me from trying my best&mdash;with the limited perspective I had&mdash;to get to the edge of the field?</p><p>No.</p><p>I would carry on. I would do all in my power to move forward&mdash;the same as anyone else.</p><hr><p>And then I realized I&rsquo;m already in that field. We all are. Every day.</p><p>From the perspective of the universe, of a prime mover, of a consciousness we can imagine but cannot understand&mdash;we are no different than the pillbug.</p><p>Every day we take action based on limited knowledge.</p><p>We may understand that the road we take will lead to the grocery store, but do we know enough to predict how tomorrow will look? Five years from now?</p><p>How can we take action with such limited information?</p><p><em>How can we choose a direction to travel in a field of maize?</em></p><hr><p>Even considering all this: <em>I am happy.</em></p><p>While I watched that pillbug travel, assuming it was lost, I was enjoying the heat of the sun. I was taking solace in simple pleasure.</p><p>At a cosmic level, we are all lost, and yet, <em>we can find contentment.</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m grateful.</p><p>While I was enjoying watching the pillbug, I like to imagine it was enjoying its life as well.</p><p class=date>2021-08-01</p></article></main></body></html>
