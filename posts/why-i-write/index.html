In any given week, I spend a significant portion of time collecting thoughts, writing them out, editing them to the bone, and publishing them.</p><p>This is time I could be spending on anything&mdash;time that I will never get back.</p><p><em>Why do it?</em></p><h2 id=i-clarity-of-thinking>I. Clarity of thinking</h2><p>How vivid are your ideas?</p><p>Are they vivid, or is their purity fooling you into believing they&rsquo;re more composed than they really are?</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to fool yourself when you haven&rsquo;t written something down&mdash;to believe you know something when you don&rsquo;t.</p><p>When our ideas are left in our minds, whether they&rsquo;re theories of life, plans for the future, or reflections on an argument we had a year ago, they tend to appear perfect. Before we communicate an idea, whether through composition on the page or speaking to a friend, it&rsquo;s as if our mind is holding only the platonic ideal of the idea.</p><p>The idea represents itself as a perfect sphere, an abstract ideal that only when described in physical reality&mdash;when brought to life&mdash;will show its imperfections.</p><p>To clarify, <em>those imperfections were always there.</em> But only through the communication of the abstract idea into reality will you be able to observe them.</p><p>And only once you&rsquo;ve observed the imperfections can you begin to improve upon them.</p><h2 id=ii-my-past-self>II. My past self</h2><p>Often I write as if I were speaking to, or put more accurately, pleading with my past self.</p><p>While I&rsquo;m happy with my life, I&rsquo;ve made my fair share of mistakes in life, and writing helps to address and learn from these mistakes.</p><p>Reflection through writing can help put the past to rest and help one grow from their regrets. Not to mention, if what I write can help even one kindred spirit avoid my mistakes, it&rsquo;ll all have been worth it.</p><p>Putting my thoughts to page enforces advice that I would be willing to give to others&mdash;and reminds me to take it myself.</p><h2 id=iii-in-short>III. In short</h2><p>I believe that to live an intentional life, you must be self-reflective.</p><p>And I find writing to be the deepest form of reflection possible.</p><p class=date>2021-07-31</p></article></main></body></html>
