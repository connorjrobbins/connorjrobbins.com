It seems like the world is created to chip away our attention.</p><p><em>And it&rsquo;s working.</em></p><p>We&rsquo;ve all gotten used to this era of checking your email while waiting in line at the grocery store. The pop-up reminder for our next meeting covering the screen before the current meeting is even over no longer surprises us. It probably doesn&rsquo;t even annoy us anymore.</p><p>In fact, we might enjoy it.</p><p>This ever-growing need to fill our moments with <em>more</em>&mdash;no matter what that more may be&mdash;seems like an addiction. One that is constantly enabled by everything surrounding us.</p><p>In a talk by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nbcaGyQrf4">Richard Jolly</a>, he coined this &ldquo;hurry-sickness.&rdquo;</p><p>See how many of these apply to you:</p><ul><li>When you microwave something for 30 seconds, you feel the need to do something while you wait</li><li>You catch a buzz from just barely making a bus, train, or flight</li><li>You find waiting in a line, for anything, incredibly irritating</li><li>Finding yourself wanting to interrupt people frequently or wishing that they&rsquo;d get their ideas across faster</li><li>Multi-tasking during work calls</li><li>Browsing your phone while streaming content on another device</li><li>Pressing an elevator&rsquo;s close door button or a street crossing button several times</li></ul><p>Shockingly, that video was recorded 5 years ago. I wonder what Richard Jolly would have to say in the age of TikTok.</p><p>In that talk, Jolly was speaking in the context of business development. He argues that this hurry-sickness is destroying our ability to stop and think, and with this, killing our ability to create value.</p><p>But it applies just as well to our personal lives.</p><p>Without stopping to think, how can we hope to be present in the moment? How can we hope for our decisions to be intentional?</p><p>To experience the present requires a moment of quiet contemplation. Filling our attention so thoroughly might please our brains, but it kills our spirit.</p><p class=date>2021-11-14</p></article></main></body></html>
