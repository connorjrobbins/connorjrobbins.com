We have our routines, we feel secure. We have an understanding of the world around us and our place within it. And, for many, that is enough.</p><p>But others feel a desire for something different, something new.</p><p><em>They want their life to change.</em></p><p>But what changes one&rsquo;s life?</p><hr><p>According to the narrative structure known as <em>The Hero&rsquo;s Journey,</em> the answer to this question lies in &ldquo;the call to adventure,&rdquo; the opening plot point which sees our hero&rsquo;s normal life disturbed by a call to head into the unknown.</p><p>This is how the story begins. This is how the hero&rsquo;s life becomes irrevocably changed. The beginning of it all lies entirely out of our hero&rsquo;s hands&mdash;they are <em>called</em> into the unknown. An <em>external</em> force jolts them from normalcy.</p><p>But, the truth is, this isn&rsquo;t how real life usually works. <em>Rarely do we ever get that call.</em><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>Like the hero, we exist in a situation of normalcy. Unlike the hero, we&rsquo;re destined to live that way for our entire lives&mdash;<em><strong>unless we call upon ourselves.</strong></em></p><hr><p>But why is it that we struggle to call upon ourselves?</p><p>We have a desire, the path may even be known to us, yet we never take that first step.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The Hero&rsquo;s Journey has an answer for this as well. Right after the call is another plot point, this one referred to as &ldquo;refusal of the call.&rdquo;</p><p>Before the call, the hero is living a comfortable life, and this adventure into the unknown represents not only a great change but often great discomfort. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched a movie you know that heroes rarely ever make it to the end unscathed. Usually, they&rsquo;ll have changed for the better, but not without great stress, pain, and tragedy.</p><p>And like these stories, this remains true for real life. Most callings in life require some discomfort. The most extraordinary lives are not without pain.</p><hr><p>But, unlike the hero, we are not called upon, and so we wait in our comfort for our hand to be forced. We are taught that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and so we settle for our lives of normalcy eschewing the possible adventure that lies before us.</p><p><em>Choosing to walk a bed of coals is made harder from the comfort of a bed of silk.</em></p><p>We must accept that it&rsquo;s unlikely our hand will ever be forced. And so we must call upon ourselves. And only when our desire outweighs our fear can we take that first step.</p><hr><p>Our life is nothing more than the stories we tell ourselves.</p><p>In stories, the hero is often forced into discomfort&mdash;forced into a situation that will change their life forever. In reality, this is rare. More often than not it&rsquo;s up to us to make the tough decision and be the creator of our own story&mdash;to spur ourselves into discomfort, trusting that we&rsquo;ll make it to the other side.</p><p>Maybe then the question to ask is not &ldquo;When does your story begin?&rdquo; but instead <em><strong>when will you begin your story?</strong></em></p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with one final thought&mdash;a nice story to tell ourselves:</p><blockquote><p>Things that were hard to bear are sweet to remember.</p><p>- Seneca</p></blockquote><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>There certainly are many life-altering events that are outside of our control, but usually, these are not calls to adventure.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><p class=date>2021-08-14</p></article></main></body></html>
