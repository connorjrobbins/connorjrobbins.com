Eventually I picked one that fit all my possible eventual needs, but required extensive customization. After all this work I was so exhausted that I gave up.</p><p>The second time I started writing online I decided I wouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistake, instead I would just write the entire thing from scratch. You can imagine how this ended up. (Note: I did end up publishing my site online, and I&rsquo;m still very proud of that work, however, it did not get me into the habit of publishing often.)</p><p>The third time I started writing, and hopefully the last, I went with a pre-existing platform because I knew it would be good enough to start doing the <em>real work</em>&mdash;that is, to start publishing often.</p><p>All this to say I, like many, have a bad habit of the <em>depth first search.</em> Before we can feel comfortable taking the first step, we need to be certain that it&rsquo;ll be the first step of the optimal approach.</p><p>This is not only ridiculous, it gets in your way.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had to learn this lesson over and over, but each time it gets a little easier and I catch myself a little quicker. Now when starting a project I try to ask myself &ldquo;What is the <em>true purpose?</em> What am I trying to develop?&rdquo;</p><p>Now, if your purpose is to learn about html, css, seo, open graph markup, etc. Then writing something from scratch might be the right approach. But, if your purpose is to <strong>publish writing online</strong> then all of that additional work only serves to distract.</p><p>In this specific case the easy way out&mdash;going with a system I don&rsquo;t need to think about&mdash;is what empowers me to do the real work.</p><p>The advice I would give myself:</p><ul><li>Start now</li><li>Start simply</li><li>Focus on the meaningful work</li><li>Ignore everything else</li></ul><p>Or, otherwise put, &ldquo;take the easy way out.&rdquo;</p><p class=date>2021-04-24</p></article></main></body></html>
