Simple. You just look at his or her actions. It is not what people say, wish, hope, or intend that counts. It is only what they do, and especially what they do when faced with temptation or put under pressure.</p></blockquote><p>These are two different ways of looking at the same concept. Our actions may be the outcome of a complex system, but they always resolve to what we most want to be doing. <strong>Regardless of what we tell ourselves.</strong></p><p>If there is something you <em>think</em> you should be doing, why aren&rsquo;t you doing it? Do you feel some resistance?</p><p><em>What is causing this gap between intention and action?</em></p><p>Try to better understand the beliefs, values, and motivations that are leading you on your present course and, if needed, make some adjustments.</p><p><strong>Perhaps consider being more accepting of who you are.</strong> There is nothing wrong with spending some time relaxing, reading emails.</p><p>Feel satisfied in deliberate action, whatever the action may be.</p><p class=date>2021-04-25</p></article></main></body></html>
