But I mean portfolio in a more general sense of the word. Any body of publicly available work can be considered a portfolio.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a data scientist it may be some models you&rsquo;ve created and the analysis write-up that goes along with it. If you&rsquo;re a writer it may be some flash fiction or articles you&rsquo;ve written. Even someone as unlikely to have a portfolio as an accountant may publish their thoughts on how IFRS will impact the particular industry they&rsquo;re most expert at.</p><p>No matter what your career, by-work, or passions may be, I am certain there is a way you can compile some records that act as a publicly available portfolio. (Or at the very least, a portfolio you&rsquo;ll be able to show on request.)</p><p>If this concept in general interests you, I would recommend checking out <a href=https://perell.com/>David Perell</a> who is a known proponent of writing as a means of career development.</p><p>Here are some reasons why, regardless of who you are, you should have a portfolio.</p><h2 id=i-the-immediate-value-of-starting>I. The immediate value of starting</h2><p>Starting something isn&rsquo;t hard. And yet most people never do it.</p><p>You can go from having zero online presence to having a blog online in less than 20 minutes and for no money down. And yet, there is a large group of people who say &ldquo;someday I&rsquo;ll sit down and start that blog.&rdquo;</p><p>Again, for most things, starting isn&rsquo;t hard.</p><p><em>And yet, most people never start.</em></p><p>This means if you do start it&rsquo;s an immediate signal.</p><p>Doing work that wasn&rsquo;t asked of you is an indication others cannot ignore.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve begun, even if you feel you haven&rsquo;t yet achieved anything, the mere act of starting is a major indicator for others.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Imagine for a moment that you&rsquo;re a relatively successful musician and you open up Twitter to see these two DMs.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey, <strong>I have a podcast</strong> where every week we interview a new musician in the NYC area. We&rsquo;d love to have you on. Are you available to chat next Tuesday at &mldr;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey, <strong>I&rsquo;m planning on starting a podcast</strong> in the next 6 months where we interview a new musician in the &mldr;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Which of those two is going to get a response?</p><p>(Or, at the very least, merit further investigation.)</p><h2 id=ii-be-prepared>II. Be prepared</h2><p>A screenwriter friend of mine once talked himself into a party. Soon enough he was rubbing elbows with some big shots and eventually he was engaged in a conversation with the head of a major network.</p><p>He had done it.</p><p>He had done what most screenwriters only ever hope to achieve. Here he was talking to someone that had the money, and the decision making ability, to turn a script into a movie.</p><p>And so this exec asked him &ldquo;Do you have anything I could read?&rdquo;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p><em>He hadn&rsquo;t finished a script.</em></p><p>The only thing worse than being caught red-handed is being caught empty-handed.</p><p>We often spend so much time focusing on how to optimize our path to success that we forget one minor detail: Doing the work.</p><p>Having a portfolio enforces that detail. To have a portfolio, you need to have done the work to bring it into existence.</p><p>It&rsquo;s obvious, but if you plan to network, if you plan to make partnerships, then it&rsquo;s in your best interest to <em>be prepared.</em></p><p>As <a href=https://twitter.com/shl>Sahil</a> would say:</p><blockquote><p>Let your work network for you, then let your network work for you.</p></blockquote><p>Next time you find yourself in the same room as someone that can help take you to the next level, <em>make sure you have a script they can read.</em></p><p class=date>2021-05-16</p></article></main></body></html>
