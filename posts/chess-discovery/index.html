But it is much simpler than that.</p><p>In chess, a discovered check is an attack on the king made possible by moving one piece out of the way of another.</p><p>For example, imagine there is a knight between your queen and your opponent&rsquo;s king. Moving the knight elsewhere gives the queen a clear line of sight to the king, revealing a check.</p><p>So what does this have to do with personal development?</p><h2 id=i-applying-this-to-ourselves>I. Applying this to ourselves</h2><p><em>Sometimes you need to get out of your own way to unleash your potential.</em></p><p>Imagine that the pieces you control on a chessboard represent aspects of yourself. The opponent&rsquo;s pieces represent obstacles that you&rsquo;ll face day-to-day. Your pieces might be beliefs you hold, habits you&rsquo;ve formed, relationships you have, etc.</p><p>So then what does it mean to move your knight out of the way of your queen?</p><p>At first blush, you might take this metaphor to mean one should move negative aspects of ourselves out of the way of our positive aspects.</p><p>For example, one might imagine the knight as negative beliefs about yourself, toxic relationships, negative habits like the content you consume.</p><p>Everyone has self-limiting aspects about themselves, and the most reflective people tend to understand them and are working to change them. With some focus and introspection, it&rsquo;s clear to see what aspects of yourself are holding you back. <em>Then, you only need to get rid of them.</em></p><p>But I think with a little more reflection on this metaphor we can reach a more nuanced conclusion.</p><h2 id=ii-the-less-obvious-aspects>II. The less obvious aspects</h2><p>What I love about this analogy is that the knight has value.</p><p>Unlike a bad habit or self-limiting belief, it&rsquo;s not something you want to be removed from the board. But, it can sometimes hold you back from the best move nonetheless. It&rsquo;s useful, but it can get in the way.</p><p><em>And often these things which are positive, but limiting, are the most difficult to see</em></p><p>Think about what <em>positive</em> aspects of yourself or actions that you take might nonetheless be getting in your way on occasion. Is your strict method of productivity putting a damper on your creativity? Is your adherence to time-boxing causing you to put down a task just as you got in the flow&mdash;just as you were on the edge of a breakthrough?</p><p>These positive aspects don&rsquo;t need to be habits, they can also be aspects of our personality. Consider, are you the type of person that says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to everything? Are you overly amiable? Both of these may be seen as positive traits, especially by those that hold them, but really reflect for a moment: Are they holding you back?</p><p>Take a moment to reflect on the traits and habits you believe are valuable. Then take a moment to see if there are any situations where those traits and habits might be limiting.</p><p><em>Seek out the edge cases of your personality traits. Refine yourself.</em></p><p>We need to remember that just because something is good for us sometimes, or even most of the time, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the best move all the time. Coming back to chess for a moment, even though a queen is the most valuable piece on the board, bringing it out early is often considered a misplay.</p><p><em>Even the most positive and powerful habits can be misused.</em></p><h2 id=iii-parting-words>III. Parting words</h2><p>Sometimes you need to go beyond &ldquo;am I following the rules I&rsquo;ve laid out for myself&rdquo; and ask &ldquo;are these rules getting in my way?&rdquo;</p><p>And do so without throwing it all out. Instead, get more nuanced with your system&mdash;make improvements. Don&rsquo;t tear things down to the foundations because you sometimes get caught on a nail poking out of the wall.</p><p><em>In many cases, the first step towards victory is not relentless pursuit, but getting out of your own way so you have the opportunity to do something extraordinary.</em></p><p class=date>2021-07-10</p></article></main></body></html>
